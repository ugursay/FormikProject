# Formik Project

This is a project built with **React** and **Formik**. It demonstrates how to create forms with validation, manage user data, and navigate between pages using React Router.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register with an email, age, password, and confirm password.
- **Form Validation**: All fields have validation using **Yup**.
- **User Data Management**: Users can see a list of registered users, update their information, or delete their accounts.
- **Toast Notifications**: Users get a message after successful actions like saving or deleting data.
- **Routing with React Router**: Navigation between different pages like user registration, user portal, and data display.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Using `useParams` to get the user ID for editing or deleting specific users.
- **Navigation with `useNavigate`**: Programmatic navigation after actions like user registration or updating data.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Formik**: A library for building forms in React with validation.
- **Yup**: A library for schema validation.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
