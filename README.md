🚀 FormikProject 📝 | React Form Management and User Operations

Hello!
I want to share my FormikProject, which I developed as part of a React course by Can Boz on Udemy. 🎉

In this project, I created a modern user form with validation using React, Formik, and Yup. I also used Axios to handle data with an API, allowing users to add, update, and delete their accounts.

📌 Technologies Used:
✅ React.js
✅ Formik
✅ Yup
✅ React Router
✅ Axios
✅ Toastify

Thanks to Can Boz for his guidance in this project! 🙏
